## 📧 Contact Form Configuration

The theme includes a contact form that needs to be configured with an email service to handle form submissions. By default, the project is set up to use [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/), but you can modify it to work with your preferred email service provider.

### Setting up EmailJS

1. Create a free account at [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/)
2. Create an email service and template in your EmailJS dashboard
3. Update your `.env` file with your EmailJS credentials:
```env
EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your-service-id
EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your-template-id
EMAILJS_USER_ID=your-public-key
```

### Using a Different Email Service

You can modify the contact form to work with any email service of your choice:

1. Choose your preferred email service provider (SendGrid, AWS SES, etc.)
2. Update the form submission logic in `src/components/ContactForm.astro`
3. Modify the environment variables in `.env` accordingly

### reCAPTCHA Integration (Optional)

To protect your form from spam:

1. Get your reCAPTCHA keys from [Google reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin)
2. Add them to your `.env`:
```env
PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=your-site-key
RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
```

### Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- Use HTTPS in production
- Regularly update your dependencies
- Consider implementing rate limiting
- Monitor your email service for any abuse

## 🎨 Customization

### Tailwind Configuration

Customize the theme by modifying `tailwind.config.mjs`:
- Colors
- Typography
- Spacing
- Breakpoints

### Content

Update the content in the `src/pages` and `src/components` directories.
